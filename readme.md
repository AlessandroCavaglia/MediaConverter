# Python media converter

This project aims to solve a specific problem, i have legaly obtained files on my web server that i like to access
whit JellyFin, some files are 4K resolution and have some strange encoding that my ipad can't seem to work with.
## Objectives

Create a script that looks for media files, check if resolution is greater than 1920x1080 and converts it in that resolution, then checks for the format and converts all in a format that my i pad air can work with. All the conversion is done with ffmpeg via command line so you don't have to install python libraries
